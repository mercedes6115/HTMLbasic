      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way: 
    </p>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Passing cars, 
      When you can't see, 
      May get you, 
      A glimpse, 
      Of eternity.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.

      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
    </p>
      <li>cellphone</li> 
      <li>iPod</li>
      <li>digital camera</li> 
      <li>and a protein bar</li> 
    <p>  
      Just the essentials.  As
      Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins
      with one Segway."
